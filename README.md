# Security checklist
A checklist for staying safe on the internet.

### Motivation
This project is the result of a conversation started during a [recent episode](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/249464) of the [Design Details Podcast](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/) and a subsequent tweet by [Michael Knepprath](https://twitter.com/mknepprath/status/1083966912420372481).

### Contributing
This project should be considered a living document of resources and applications that improve people's digital security and privacy. Contributions, edits, and extensions are welcome!

If you have resources to add to existing sections, please open a pull request.

- Aim for reputable sources for guides and news coverage.
- If adding an app, please include links to as many platforms as possible. See `config/*.js` for examples of how data is formatted.
- Try to use approachable human-readable language. Remember that even non-technical folks need to stay safe online.

If you would like to create a new category of security and privacy resources, please open an issue first with your proposed category. Please explain why this additional category should stand alone from other existing sections.
