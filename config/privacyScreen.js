  title: 'Use a laptop privacy screen',
  description: `Protect yourself from people shoulder-surfing and use your laptop in private even when working in a public space, such as a cafe or on a plane. The privacy filter blocks side views outside the 60 degree angle, thereby ensuring that people around you cannot view your screen without impeding your ability to work in open workspaces or on the go.
